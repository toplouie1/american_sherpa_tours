				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>
					Sherpa have evolved from various surrounding areas of Nepal, Tibet,
					and India and their roots are very well established as mountaineers in
					Nepal. Sherpa students are now poised to take on the world as citizens
					of the United States of America and their knowledge about where all
					this began would be a great boon to their professional career as well
					as enrichment of their lifestyle including better camaraderie within
					the community to foster growth and friendship. American Sherpa Tours
					strives to enrich the living standards of the Sherpa people in the
					United States by organizing various tours and travel within and
					outside of the United States. Students will have a glimpse of their
					immediate history visiting their parents and grandparentsâ€™ prior
					homes. They will have a chance to travel and enjoy destinations with
					their peers. Three-week summer package is developed to provide
					full-service package from airline tickets, accommodations, and travel
					within Nepal. The attractions will be Sherpa Villages in Nepal and
					tourist destinations like Kathmandu, Chitwan and Pokhara. The tour
					will also accept a Volunteer Parent to travel with the student which
					will be selected through a lottery system.

						<h3>Chongba Lama Sherpa - Supporter</h3>
						<p>
							- As a parent I believe we have to provide a better future for our
							children, as an individual of a community we have to strive to
							make that community better. I have embraced the fact that we have
							migrated to the United States. Myself and my children are citizens
							of this great nation (United States) that has embraced our being
							without prejudice. This endeavor is to educate our children where
							we came from in the immediate past and build community in the
							process.
